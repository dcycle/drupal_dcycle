The dCycle policy (different from the dCycle module, which can be used to enforce _any_ policy), use two branches:

 - the master branch which can have anything it it
 - the stage branch, managed exclusively by jenkins, which includes all code which passes tests and other quality gates.

When you develop you will use the master branch, and periodically:

git pull origin master # to get your colleagues' work

Jenkins will also update the .info file of your deployment module (each
project must have exactly one deployment module), and this change will be
committed to master and stage
