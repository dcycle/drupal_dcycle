The dcycle policy is one of the policies you can use with dcycle. Here is how
branching works in dCycle:

- Continuous integration branches are used for code that is known to work (if the project is stable). You can have only one, master for example, or 7.x-1.x, or a few, 7.x-1.x, 7.x-2.x, 8.x-2.x for example.

- When using dcycle, you should not push to these branches (see http://drupal.org/node/2007158). Rather, push to unstable branches (for example unstable).

- For each of your unstable branches, set up a jenkins job.

- often do: git origin push unstable

- Jenkins will be set up to check the unstable branch, and if tests pass, it will push to stable

- When this happens, Jenkins will also update the .info file of your deployment module (each project must have exactly one deployment module), and this change will be committed to your stable and unstable branch.
