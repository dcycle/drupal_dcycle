Jenkins for continuous integration (CI)

- Make sure coder module is installed on your site if you want to test for coding standards, and apply the patch at http://drupal.org/node/1974654 (unless it is integrated into your version of coder), or else you will get false negatives.

- Make sure your project follows dcycle guidelines and is available on a git
  repo.
- Install Jenkins (for example at http://localhost:8080/)
- Go to http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/available and make sure
  the Git Plugin, post build task and Jenkins Text Finder are available
- Configure a new project (for example dcycle)
- In the command line type (with your credentials):
echo 'create database jenkins' | mysql -uroot -proot
- Configure your Jenkins project: http://localhost:8080/job/dcycle/configure:
 - advanced project options: set a custom workspace (for example if you
   are using MAMP, it might be /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/dcycledemo_jenkins)
   which you have access to via a web browser, and not its url (for example
   http://localhost:8888/dcycledemo_jenkins)
 - make sure the jenkins user is in a group that can write to the custom
   workspace
 - make sure the jenkins user has an ssh key, and that its public key is
   recognized by your git server.
 - sudo su jenkins and git clone <git-server> (for example git clone
   git@github.com:you/yourproject.git)
 - make sure that the server is added to the list of known hosts and
   that you have read/write access.
 - set source code management to git and enter your directory in read/write
   format. In advanced, give it the name "main"
 - set it to track the master branch
 - In the build section add Execute shell:

/path/to/drush si --db-url="mysql://root:root@localhost/jenkins" -y
/path/to/drush en simpletest coder_review your_deploy_module -y
php scripts/run-tests.sh --url "http://localhost:8888/dcycledemo_jenkins/" --verbose "your test group"
/path/to/drush coder-review demo_deploy --minor

 - In post build actions add:
  - Jenkins text finder regular expression "[^0][1-9]*.(fails|exceptions|could not be found|normal warnings|minor warnings|ERROR)" and "search the console"
  - Git publisher: publish if succeeds, push to branch stage, Target remote name: "main" (which you selected previously)
  - Console:
  
cat sites/default/modules/custom/demo_deploy/demo_deploy.info | grep -v 'version' | grep -v ';following information inserted by the dcycle jenkins CI server' > sites/default/modules/custom/demo_deploy/demo_deploy.info.swp
echo ';following information inserted by the dcycle jenkins CI server' >> sites/default/modules/custom/demo_deploy/demo_deploy.info.swp 
echo 'version =' $(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S) >> sites/default/modules/custom/demo_deploy/demo_deploy.info.swp 
rm sites/default/modules/custom/demo_deploy/demo_deploy.info
mv sites/default/modules/custom/demo_deploy/demo_deploy.info.swp sites/default/modules/custom/demo_deploy/demo_deploy.info
git commit -am $(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S)

- Go back home and "build now".
