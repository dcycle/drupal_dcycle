Jenkins for continuous integration (CI)

- Make sure coder module is installed on your site if you want to test for coding standards, and apply the patch at http://drupal.org/node/1974654 (unless it is integrated into your version of coder), or else you will get false negatives.

- Make sure your project follows Dcycle guidelines and is available on a git
  repo.
- Install Jenkins (for example at http://localhost:8080/)
- Go to http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/available and make sure
  the Git Plugin, post build task and Jenkins Text Finder are available
- Configure a new project (for example Dcycle)
- In the command line type (with your credentials):
echo 'create database jenkins_[project_name]' | mysql -uroot -proot
- Configure your Jenkins project: http://localhost:8080/job/[jobname]/configure:
 - advanced project options: set a custom workspace (for example if you
   are using MAMP, it might be /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/dcycledemo_jenkins if
   you are developing a website; or something like 
   /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/dcycle_jenkins/sites/all/modules/jenkins
   if you are developing a module)
   which you have access to via a web browser, and not its url (for example
   http://localhost:8888/dcycledemo_jenkins)
 - if you are developing a module or theme, and your working directory is a 
   subdirectory of the drupal root, then set up your drupal root by downloading
   drupal (don't install the db, though)
 - if you are developing a module, add coder module to your drupal site if your
   policy requires it.
 - make sure the jenkins user can write to the custom
   workspace recursively, and if your git repo is a subdirectory of a drupal, make sure jenkins can also write to sites/default.
 - make sure the jenkins user has an ssh key, and that its public key is
   recognized by your git server.
 - sudo su jenkins and git clone <git-server> (for example git clone
   git@github.com:you/yourproject.git)
 - make sure that the server is added to the list of known hosts and
   that you have read/write access. This is done the first time your clone your
   repo, make sure to do it over a trusted network.
 - back to the jenkins UI:
   set source code management to git and enter your directory in read/write
   format. In advanced, give it the name "main", this will be important later
   on.
 - set it to track the branch associated with a given user or group of users
   working together.
 - In the build section add Execute shell:

drush si --db-url="mysql://root:root@localhost/jenkins" -y
drush en simpletest coder_review your_module -y

You will have to add the optional:

drush dcycle-test

 - In post build actions add:
  - Console output (build log) parsing:
   - mark build unstable on warning
   - mark build unstable on error
   - select parsing rules Dcycle (this is a file
  - (optional) Jenkins text finder regular expression "[^0][1-9]*.(fails|exceptions|could not be found|normal warnings|minor warnings|ERROR)" and "search the console"
  - Git publisher: publish if succeeds, push to branch master (or whatever your CI branch is, 7.x-1.x for example if you are developing a drupal module), Target remote name: "main" (which you selected previously -- if you haven't yet saved, it will tell you main does not exist, save and come back to this page and the warning should disappear)
  - Console:
  
cat sites/default/modules/custom/demo_deploy/demo_deploy.info | grep -v 'version' | grep -v ';following information inserted by the Dcycle jenkins CI server' > sites/default/modules/custom/demo_deploy/demo_deploy.info.swp
echo ';following information inserted by the Dcycle jenkins CI server' >> sites/default/modules/custom/demo_deploy/demo_deploy.info.swp 
echo 'version =' $(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S) >> sites/default/modules/custom/demo_deploy/demo_deploy.info.swp 
rm sites/default/modules/custom/demo_deploy/demo_deploy.info
mv sites/default/modules/custom/demo_deploy/demo_deploy.info.swp sites/default/modules/custom/demo_deploy/demo_deploy.info
git commit -am $(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S)

- Go back home and "build now".
- Troubleshoot by going to the "console output"; add an issue to Dcycle for support

- Troubleshooting tips:
 -- Many errors are permissions errors, make sure jenkins user can do whatever it has to. (Bring a sysadmin some cookies and ask him some questions).
 -- You will need to set the base url of your test site in the settings.php file of your jenkins Drupal site.
