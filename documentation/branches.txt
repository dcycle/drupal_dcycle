dCycle projects use two branches: the master branch which can have anything it it, and the stage branch, managed exclusively by jenkins, which includes all code which passes the tests.

When you develop you will use the master branch, and periodically:

git pull origin master # to get your colleagues' work

Jenkins will also update the .info file of your deployment module (each
project must have exactly one deployment module), and this change will be
committed to master and stage

This means that master can potentially be in a state much more advanced than
stage. Although it is preferable that this never happen, it is intentionally possible under dcycle. The development team is expected to communicate to avoid such a situation.
