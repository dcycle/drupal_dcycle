One-step deployment

Central to dcycle is the idea of one-step deployment: a single module which should, when enabled on a brand-new Drupal site, provide a fully-deployed website sans content.

This is used
- by jenkins for testing
- by developers new to the team
- by current developers for "throw-away" or experimental environments
- for the prod, stage and other environments.

To this end you must provide exactly one module entitled sites/*/modules/custom/*_deploy; which is found by the function 
dcycle_deployment_module().
